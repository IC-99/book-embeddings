In this thesis, we address the problem of enumerating 1-page book embeddings, also known as 1-stack layouts, of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). We first introduce and discuss an existing linear-time algorithm developed by Heath and Pemmaraju more than two decades ago, which determines whether a given DAG admits a 1-stack layout and, in the positive case, outputs one such layout. Building on their work, we devised a novel algorithm that enumerates all possible 1-stack layouts of a given DAG without repetitions. The proposed algorithm achieves a time delay of O(n) between consecutive layouts, where n represents the number of nodes in the graph. It leverages the structure of the block-cutpoint tree to efficiently handle cutpoints and permutable blocks, allowing for the systematic generation of distinct layouts. Additionally, we derive a formula to count the total number of possible 1-stack layouts for a given DAG, thus contributing to the theoretical understanding of the problem. Furthermore, the algorithm has been implemented as a C++ library adopted in a WebAssembly application, enabling an efficient, web-based interface that supports interactive exploration of the generated layouts.
